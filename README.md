# Teashop.github.io

Using images supplied from the course im currently studying I was tasked with creating a website
Using the example website as inspiration I tweaked the coloursets to match a coffee esc store with alot of darker cream colours
When difficult scenarios would arise I would use AI to help me understand what I was tring to implememt.
Comparing this project and the Cheatsheet I implemented flexboxes as they are the latest thing I'be learnt so far
